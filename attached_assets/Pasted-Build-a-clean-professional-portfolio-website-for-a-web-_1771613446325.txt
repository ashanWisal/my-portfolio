Build a clean, professional portfolio website for a web developer named "Ahsan Wisal" 
with 2 years of experience. Use a single HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript. 
No frameworks, no build tools — just plain HTML/CSS/JS so it runs directly on Replit.

DESIGN:
- Dark theme with a dark background (#0f0f0f or #111111)
- Accent color: use a subtle cyan or blue (#00bcd4 or #3b82f6) — NOT pink, NOT neon
- Clean, minimal, professional layout — no over-the-top animations
- Fully responsive (mobile + desktop)
- Smooth scroll behavior
- Subtle fade-in on scroll for sections

SECTIONS (in this order):
1. NAVBAR — fixed top, name on left, nav links on right (Home, About, Skills, Projects, Contact)

2. HERO — profile photo on one side, text on other side. 
   Name: "Ahsan Wisal"
   Title: "Full Stack Web Developer"
   Subtitle: "2 Years of Experience | Building modern web apps"
   Two buttons: "View Projects" and "Contact Me"
   NOTE: Add a placeholder <img> tag with id="profile-photo" so I can replace the src later.

3. ABOUT — 3-4 lines about being a passionate full stack developer who builds 
   scalable web applications with modern technologies.

4. SKILLS — display as tag/badge style chips, grouped in two rows:
   Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, 
             Material UI, shadcn/ui
   Backend: Node.js, NestJS, MongoDB, MySQL
   Deployment: Vercel, Netlify

5. PROJECTS — card grid (3 cards), each card has:
   - Project title (placeholder: "Project One", "Project Two", "Project Three")
   - Short description (2 lines)
   - Tech stack tags
   - Two buttons: "Live Demo" and "GitHub" (use # as href for now)

6. CONTACT — simple section with email placeholder, 
   and icon links for GitHub, LinkedIn (use # as href)

7. FOOTER — "Built by Ahsan Wisal © 2025"

CODE QUALITY:
- Write clean, commented code
- Use CSS variables for colors so I can easily change the theme
- No external libraries except Google Fonts (use "Inter" font)
- All sections should have proper id attributes for smooth scroll to work
